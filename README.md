# Defeat Repeat: Outfit Tracker
This Single Page Application allows users to make posts with an image, date, notes and tags to keep track of their outfits. Users are able to upload an existing image or upload one using the webcam, as well as filtering their posts by a tag.

I don't mind being an outfit repeater but sometimes I like to keep things fresh. Rather than trying to remember what I wore the last time I met up with a friend, defeatRepeat will keep track for me so I can wear another outfit!

## Setup Steps
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Use `npm start` to spin up the server.

## Planning Story
For this capstone project, I wanted to build an application that would challenge me to utilize the skills I've learned over the last 12 weeks plus some stretch goals. This project aims to meet a practical need I have on a regular basis (outfit repeating) as well as showcase my tech knowledge.

Once I decided on the idea with user stories, I decided on a tech stack, researched the necessary npm packages and got to wireframing!

The biggest struggle I faced through the 4 day project sprint was understanding React and knowing how to best utilize this awesome framework. Related to this, incorporating the various packages also proved to be a challenge. However, through LOTS of googling, patient instructional team and motivating classmates, Defeat Repeat is born!
